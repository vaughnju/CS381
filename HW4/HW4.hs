-- Note: in this file, we're placing the AST argument as the *last* argument in
-- each function, rather than the first argument. Although this makes the
-- semantic domains less obvious, it's good FP style since it promotes partial
-- application and can make some of your definitions a bit simpler.


-- Some functions from the Prelude that may be helpful on this assignment:
--
--   all :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
--     Returns true if the function returns true for every element in the list.
--
--   elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
--     Returns true if the first argument is contained as an element in the list.


-- This comment is defining some MiniLogo expressions used in doctests.

-- ** Semantic functions

-- In this section, we're assuming we already ran the static checker. This
-- means that you can use the 'getOrFail' function to lookup entries in either
-- the variable environment or macro environment, and you can use the 'setAll'
-- function to add arguments to an environment without first checking that you
-- have the correct number.
--
-- Remember that in this assignment we're making the AST type the last argument
-- in each function to support a nicer functional programming style, even
-- though this obfuscates the semantic domains a bit. The semantic domain of
-- each syntactic category is listed below for reference and then briefly
-- explained.
--
-- Semantic domains:
--   * Expr:  Env -> Int
--   * Cmd:   Macros -> Env -> State -> (State, [Line])
--   * Block: Macros -> Env -> State -> (State, [Line])
--   * Prog:  [Line]
--
-- The semantics of expressions requires only the variable environment, and
-- this environment is read-only since expressions cannot change the values of
-- variables.

-- In addition to the variable environment, the semantics of commands and
-- blocks also takes a macro environment (Macros), which stores macro
-- definitions. The macro environment maps macro names to a pair
-- '(Pars,Block)', where the first element of the pair is the list of
-- parameters that the macro declares, and second element is the body of the
-- macro. You will have to use the macro environment in the semantics of
-- commands to implement macro calls.
--
-- Unlike in Homework 4, commands may now produce an arbitrary number of lines
-- (not just 0 or 1) because of macro calls and for loops. So, the semantic
-- domain of commands now produces a list of lines rather than a 'Maybe Line'.
--
-- Programs are run on initially empty environments and a well-defined initial
-- pen state (Up,(0,0)), so the semantic function doesn't take any arguments
-- besides the program itself. We also return only the lines drawn by the
-- program as a result since we no longer care about the pen state once the
-- program has completely finished running.
